# "Fibonacci, Assemble!"
Just a regular fibonacci series generator, but in assembly :)

## Setup
- Make sure to have `nasm` installed. You can refer [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_environment_setup.htm) for environment setup. 
- Run `make` to build the program and run it. Use `make clean` to clear the executable and object file.
